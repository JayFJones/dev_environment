# dev_environment

This is how I develop. Regardless of which host I am on, I prefer to use ScotchBox.  Consider going Pro.


## Installation
1. Install Git (If on Windows https://git-scm.com/download/win)
1. Install VirtualBox
2. Install Vagrant
3. Install ScotchBox


## Setting up VIM
1. Install Vundle (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
 - Make sure to remove the "example" plugins as some will not resolve (they are examples afterall).
2. Copy over the vimrc from this directory.
3. Run :PluginInstall from vim.

## Anytime I update my ~/.vim/vimrc file I do the following:
1. :source %
2. :PluginInstall 
3. Copy the ~/.vim/vimrc to this repo.
